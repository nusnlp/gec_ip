## Prerequisites

```
conda create --name comb python=3.6
conda activate comb
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en
```

For the nonlinear integer programming solver, we use 

```
LINGO10.0
```


## Example

Combine the 3 GEC systems listed in the paper using the IP approach. The three systems are UEdin-MS (https://aclanthology.org/W19-4427), Kakao (https://aclanthology.org/W19-4423), and Tohoku (https://aclanthology.org/D19-1119). The core functions for the IP objective are implemented in model.lg4. You can find model.lg4 under `lingo/inputs`.

1. Run `python prepare_data.py -dir . -list kakao uedinms tohoku` to generate aggregated TP, FP, and FN counts. The counts files are stored under `lingo/inputs`.

2. Load model.lg4 into the LINGO console and specify the input data path with the counts file path, select the INLP model, and run optimizations. Store the solutions to `lingo/outputs/sol_kakao_uedinms_tohoku.txt`.

3. Run `./comb.sh . sol_kakao_uedinms_tohoku.txt` to load LINGO solutions, merge and apply edits. The resulted blind test file can be found under `submissions`. It can be zipped and submitted to the BEA CodeLab website (https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20228) for evaluations.


The `data` folder provides individual GEC system output files, and .m2 files generated using ERRANT for the listed systems. For more information, please visit the [ERRANT github page](https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant).

We include the IP combined .m2 files under `merged_m2`, and the corresponding text files under `submissions`.
